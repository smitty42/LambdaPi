Step #1) 
	Install Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 amd(64bit) into Virtualbox 4

Step #2) 
	Make sure that openssh-server is installed in the guest machine.
	If it is not, you can install it with “sudo apt-get install openssh-server”.

Step #3) 
	Open a terminal (on the host) and login to the guest. On my network the 	guest's IP address is “192.168.0.174” so I used “ssh user@192.1683.0.174”. 	The address will likely be different for you.

Step #4)
	in the guest run:
	sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential python-support mercurial nginx


Step #5)
	in the guest run:
	sudo pip install tornado

Step #6)
	navigate in to /home/user (on the guest)
	Do hg checkout stuff.

Step #7)
	CD into picloud_demo/tests and run:
	python server_test.py

	next, have any browser on the host connect to port 8888 on your 	guests' IP 	address. On my workstation I used “192.168.0.174:8888”. You should see a 	simple “hello would” webpage.

Step #8)
	Create a picloud account.

Step #9)
	Download and install picloud.
	Run: sudo dpkg -i  [most recent picloud.deb file from picloud]. I used “sudo dpkg -i cloud_2.7.6-1_all.deb”

Step #10)
	run:
 	python picloud_test.py
